  helpProviders: {
    what: "What is a Provider?",
    whatDesc: "A Provider is an API configuration for AI CLI tools to connect to AI services. The platform supports unified management of Providers for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, etc. Each Provider contains API Key, Base URL, application type, and more.",
    whatTip: "You can configure multiple Providers per app. The first enabled Provider (by sort order) is used during export.",
    types: "Provider Types",
    typesDesc: "• Official Login: Use official account (Anthropic/OpenAI), no API Key needed. Only for apps supporting OAuth\n• PackyCode: Third-party API proxy. Requires API Key from PackyCode. Base URL auto-filled\n• Custom: Fully custom API endpoint for self-hosted proxies or other API providers",
    typesTip: "When using Official Login or PackyCode, the Base URL is auto-filled based on the selected app type.",
    howTo: "How to Configure?",
    howToDesc: "1. Click \"Add Provider\" and choose a preset template or fill in manually\n2. Select the target application (Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode)\n3. Enter API Key (can be left empty for Official Login)\n4. Custom type requires manual Base URL entry\n5. Toggle controls whether this Provider is included in exports\n6. Use the copy button to quickly clone existing configurations",
    test: "Connection Test",
    testDesc: "Click the test icon (lightning/signal) on the card. The system sends a probe request to verify network connectivity and API Key validity.\n\n• Green ✓ — Connection successful, latency shown\n• Red ✗ — Connection failed, with specific reason (timeout, 401 unauthorized, network unreachable, etc.)",
    testTip: "Testing only checks endpoint reachability and Key validity — no API credits are consumed. Official Login type cannot be tested remotely.",
  },
  helpMcp: {
    what: "What is an MCP Server?",
    whatDesc: "MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers provide AI tools with extended capabilities like file I/O, web requests, database queries, browser automation, and more. By configuring MCP Servers, AI tools can invoke external services for complex tasks.",
    whatTip: "MCP is an open protocol by Anthropic, adopted by Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other tools.",
    transport: "Transport Types",
    transportDesc: "• Stdio (Standard I/O): Starts a local process via command, communicates through stdin/stdout. Best for most scenarios like npx-based MCP services\n• HTTP: Connects to a remote HTTP endpoint. For cloud-deployed MCP services\n• SSE (Server-Sent Events): Communicates via event streams. For real-time push scenarios",
    transportTip: "Most MCP Servers use Stdio. Choose HTTP or SSE for remotely deployed services.",
    templates: "Template Library",
    templatesDesc: "The platform provides one-click templates in 5 categories:\n\n🌐 Browser & Testing: Playwright, Puppeteer, etc.\n🔍 Search & Network: mcp-fetch, Brave Search, Context7, etc.\n💾 Data & Storage: SQLite, PostgreSQL, filesystem, memory, etc.\n🛠️ Dev Tools: GitHub, Sequential Thinking, etc.\n💬 Collaboration: Slack, etc.\n\nClick a template name to instantly create the MCP Server configuration.",
    templatesTip: "Templates are fully editable after creation. Some (like databases) require path parameter modifications.",
    env: "Environment Variables",
    envDesc: "Configure runtime environment variables for MCP Servers, such as:\n• API Token / Secret Key — for authentication\n• File paths — specify working directories\n• Database connection strings — specify data sources\n\nVariables are set as key-value pairs. Multiple variables supported.",
    envTip: "Use environment variables for sensitive info (API Keys) rather than hardcoding in command arguments.",
    bindings: "App Bindings",
    bindingsDesc: "Each MCP Server can be bound to one or more target apps (Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode).\n\n• Bound apps will include this MCP Server during app-specific export\n• Unbound apps won't include it\n• Full export always includes all MCP Servers regardless of bindings",
    bindingsTip: "Check all relevant apps if an MCP Server should be available across multiple tools.",
  },
  helpSkills: {
    what: "What are Skills?",
    whatDesc: "Skills are predefined AI skill packs, typically hosted in GitHub repositories. Each Skill contains domain-specific instructions, context, and best practices to help AI tools better handle specific tasks (code review, test generation, architecture design, etc.).",
    whatTip: "Skills were originally designed by Anthropic for Claude Code. This platform extends support for Skills from any GitHub repository.",
    repos: "Repository Management",
    reposDesc: "Add GitHub repositories as Skills sources. Each repo config includes:\n• Owner + Repo name — e.g., anthropics/skills\n• Branch — defaults to main, can specify others\n• Subdirectory — if Skills aren't in the repo root\n• Default flag — marked repos are displayed first\n\nBuilt-in preset categories (Skills repos, Dev, Design, Office, etc.) allow quick addition.",
    reposTip: "Private repos may require GitHub API authorization. Public repos need no authentication.",
    scan: "Scan & Install",
    scanDesc: "1. After adding a repo, click the \"Scan Skills\" button on the repo card\n2. The system reads the repo's directory structure via GitHub API, discovering available Skills (each subdirectory = one Skill)\n3. It also tries to read each Skill's README.md for descriptions\n4. Discovered Skills appear in the \"Skills\" tab\n5. Use toggles to install/uninstall — installed Skills are included in exports",
    scanTip: "Scanning uses GitHub API with a 60 requests/hour limit (unauthenticated). For large repos, specify a subdirectory to narrow the scan.",
    views: "Views & Filtering",
    viewsDesc: "The Skills list supports two view modes:\n• Card view — grid layout for visual overview\n• List view — table layout for dense information\n\nFilter by name/description search, installation status, or source repository.",
  },
  helpPrompts: {
    what: "What are Prompts?",
    whatDesc: "Prompts are system prompt presets that guide AI CLI tool behavior and style. Different AI tools use different config files for system prompts. This platform provides unified management and app-specific export.",
    whatTip: "System prompts define AI behavior preferences, coding style, response language, etc. Proper configuration significantly improves the experience.",
    target: "Target File Mapping",
    targetDesc: "Each Prompt selects a target file that determines the exported filename:\n\n• CLAUDE.md → Claude Code — placed in project root, auto-loaded on startup\n• AGENTS.md → Codex — OpenAI Codex CLI system prompt file\n• GEMINI.md → Gemini CLI — Google Gemini CLI custom instructions\n• OPENCODE.md → OpenCode — OpenCode CLI prompt configuration",
    targetTip: "CLAUDE.md supports hierarchical loading: root-level applies globally, subdirectory-level applies only within that directory.",
    editor: "Editor Features",
    editorDesc: "Prompt content uses Markdown format, supporting:\n• Heading levels (# ## ###)\n• Lists (ordered/unordered)\n• Code blocks (inline and block)\n• Emphasis (bold/italic)\n• Links and quotes\n\nSwitch to the \"Preview\" tab for live Markdown rendering. Content limit: 50,000 characters.",
    editorTip: "Use clear heading structure to organize prompts: # Role Definition → # Coding Standards → # Output Format.",
    active: "Activation Management",
    activeDesc: "Each Prompt can be individually activated/deactivated:\n\n• Active Prompts are automatically used as target file content during app-specific export\n• Multiple Prompts can exist per target file, but only one should be active to avoid conflicts\n• Deactivated Prompts are preserved and can be reactivated anytime\n• The card toggle allows quick activation switching",
    activeTip: "Create multiple Prompts per tool (e.g., \"Daily Dev\", \"Code Review\", \"Doc Writing\") and switch activation by scenario.",
    optimizer: "Prompt Optimizer",
    optimizerDesc: "Built-in AI-powered prompt optimization to help you:\n• Analyze existing prompt structure and coverage\n• Auto-optimize wording and fill missing key instructions\n• Reorganize content following best practice templates\n• Support feedback and iteration on optimization results",
    optimizerTip: "The optimizer uses industry best practices, but final effectiveness depends on your use case. Review carefully before applying.",
  },
  helpExport: {
    what: "Export Overview",
    whatDesc: "Export platform configurations into file formats directly usable by local AI CLI tools. Three modes: full backup, module export, and app-specific export for different needs.",
    whatTip: "Exported files can be placed in project directories or user config folders — AI CLI tools auto-load them on startup.",
    full: "Full Export (ZIP)",
    fullDesc: "Bundle all modules (Providers, MCP Servers, Skills, Prompts) into a ZIP containing:\n• providers.json — all Provider configs\n• mcp_servers.json — all MCP Server configs\n• prompts.json — all Prompt content\n• skills.json — all Skill states\n• skills_repos.json — all repo configs\n\nIdeal for complete backup, cross-device migration, or team sharing.",
    module: "Module Export",
    moduleDesc: "Export individual modules as JSON files for selective import or backup:\n• Providers — export all Provider configs\n• MCP Servers — export all MCP Server configs\n• Prompts — export all Prompt content\n• Skills — export all Skill installation states\n\nExported JSON files can be restored via the Import function.",
    moduleTip: "The number shown next to each button indicates the current data count for that module.",
    app: "App Export",
    appDesc: "Export in each AI tool's native format, ready to use:\n\n• Claude Code → settings.json (Provider + MCP config) + CLAUDE.md (active prompt)\n• Codex → codex-config.json + AGENTS.md\n• Gemini CLI → gemini-settings.json + GEMINI.md\n• OpenCode → opencode-config.json + OPENCODE.md\n\nOnly exports enabled Providers and app-bound MCP Servers.",
    appTip: "Before exporting, ensure the target app's Provider is enabled, MCP Servers are bound, and Prompt is activated.",
    import: "Import Config",
    importDesc: "Restore configurations from JSON files. Supports importing:\n• Providers — auto-detected by provider_type field\n• MCP Servers — auto-detected by transport_type field\n• Prompts — auto-detected by target_file field\n\nImporting appends new records without overwriting existing data.",
    importTip: "Import files must be JSON arrays. Use module export to generate standard format files first.",
    deepLink: "Deep Link Sharing",
    deepLinkDesc: "Generate a shareable link containing enabled Provider configs (excluding API Keys). Recipients can import with one click:\n\n1. Click \"Generate Link\" to create a share URL\n2. Copy and send the link to team members\n3. Recipients open the link and confirm import\n\nGreat for quick team distribution of Provider templates.",
    deepLinkTip: "Deep Links exclude sensitive info like API Keys. Recipients need to fill in their own. Link validity depends on URL parameter length.",
